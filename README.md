  Well, talking a little about myself ... I am a development student graduated and studying at the [Senai school](https://informatica.sp.senai.br/), where I learned to develop systems, such as creating websites and ApiÂ´s, and also to create applications for cell phones.

I got to know this fantastic universe of programming through the [Senai school](https://github.com/senai-desenvolvimento), where they not only taught me how to develop systems, but how to develop myself as a person and as a professional, always instigating me to challenge myself and have a constant evolutionary process day after day. And today, I am a fullstack developer who is always open to new opportunities and challenges!<p>
